# Responsive-Portfolio
Adding media queries to make my portfolio mobile responsive.

## Technologies used: 
Visual Studio Code, YouTube for demonstrational videos, google for proper meta tag/viewport tag format

## summary: The purpose of this assignment was to format our site with a responsive, scalable format using raw CSS and without technologies such as Bootstrap.

## Steps:

1. I started by pulling the repo down to my local machine where I pasted in the templates for index.html, contact.html, portfolio.html, and styles.css.

2. I watched a couple of YouTube videos demonstrating how responsive works with media queries and gave it a try on my end. 

3. Played around with styling elements such as floats, etc. to format the div container on the top left portion of the screen under 980px.

4. Used height and weigth properties to style the container in the correct location under 768px.

5. Set the headmast and the nav tag to 100% width so that one would override the other. Changed the photo size to 100% width. The main-container div was then set to 100% width and I added top margin so that there was break between the nav and the container.I also added padding on the left of the nav so that the options were centered.
